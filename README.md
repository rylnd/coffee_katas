Coffee Katas
---------

To run a kata's tests, change to its directory (e.g. `fizzbuzz/`) and run the `jasmine` script.
This will compile the coffeescript files and open the test runner in your browser.

### [FizzBuzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizz_buzz)
----
Enough said. FizzBuzz in a class, with an optional count.

```javascript
FizzBuzz.count(3);
// => [ 1, 2, 'fizz' ]
```

### [Y Combinator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Y_combinator)
----
Again, not much to say about this one.
See [YCombSpec.coffee](https://github.com/ryalnd/coffee_katas/blob/master/ycomb/spec/YCombSpec.coffee) for examples of how to use it.
